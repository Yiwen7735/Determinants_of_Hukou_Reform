# Determinants of Hukou Reform in 2014
The repository is used to store the code used to process data for the determinants of hukou reform project, 
serving the reproducible purpose of research.

The dataset of this research project is stored in PolicyData.xlsx, which is constructed by me and Dr. Julia Wang based on the 
official policy documents issued by each Chinese province (except Ningxia). The idea is inspired by DEMIG (Determinants
of International Migration) POLICY, a database taht has collected information about cross-border migration across 45 countries in Europe over
the period of 1945-2013.
